SPECS
// The game starts and a predetermined series of notes began to fall on one of
   the 6 columns.
// There are six columns
// Depending on the column that the notes are falling on, you would have to press
   a specific key that corresponds to that column, when the note reaches the very
   bottom of the board.
// As you correctly hit the key when the notes reach the bottom you get a point
// The game ends when either the player misses to many notes or when all the notes
   finish.
